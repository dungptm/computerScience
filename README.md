# computerScience projects
- Book cover recognition based object matching
- Trajectory recovery: a triagulization based skeletoninsation approach for reconstructing the trajectory.
- Face tracking: using adaboost approach
- Face recognition (pca): principal component analysis for face recognition
- Face recognition (SIFT): SIFT-based feature for face recognition
- Ray casting: 
  •	 Using ray casting algorithm to render objects including ball, plane, triangle and implicit object with some effects such as diffusion, highlight, shadow, reflection, refraction.
  •	Render stereo pair image.
  •	Apply anti-aliasing to improve image quality.
- Fingerprint recognition: simulation for a system in banking transaction
- Bilinear interpolation: a resampling method that uses the distance-weighted average of the four
nearest pixel values to estimate a new pixel value.
